Known Bugs:

- After replaying multiple times, the animation becomes faster.
- Doesn't currently work if there are more than 3 channels for all joints other than the root.
- Might want to link up scaling to sliders.
- The grid doesn't change orientation when you change the up vector --> might make the interface more usable and friendly.
