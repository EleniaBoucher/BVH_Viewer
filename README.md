Known Bugs:

- After replaying multiple times, the animation becomes faster.
- Doesn't currently work if there are more than 3 channels for all joints other than the root.
- Might want to link up scaling to sliders.
- The grid doesn't change orientation when you change the up vector --> might make the interface more usable and friendly.

To Do:

- Frame by frame playing -->Works going forward, need to implement going back frames +
- Set the scene automatically -- detect bounding box and adjust the up vector and scale according to that -->+
- Different environment/body model/ground
- Going backwards frame by frame -> very small bug +
- starting perspective more user-friendly + 
- responsive layout +
- buttons on the side +
- icons for play/pause +
- automatically scale bones (keep track of max bone size, if below certain amount scale bones up) +



Increase Performance:

- Trace toggle button could be more efficient --> DONE
